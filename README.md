# emoji-js
A tiny script that replaces :colon-codes: with emoji.

# How do I use it?
For now, you have to download the script and manually place it into your project.

Then put the following in your HTML's head:
`<script type="text/javascript" src="emoji.js"></script`

To emojify a string:
x = emojify(y)

If y is `:wave: hello!` then x will be set to `ðŸ‘‹ hello`.

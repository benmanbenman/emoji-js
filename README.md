# emoji-js
A tiny script that replaces :colon-codes: with emoji.

# how do I use it?
For now, you have to download the script and manually place it into your project.

Then put the following in your HTML's head:
`<script type="text/javascript" src="emoji.js"></script`

To emojify a string:
`x = emojify(y)`

If `y` is `:wave: hello!` then `x` will be set to `ðŸ‘‹ hello!`.

# coming soon
A demojify function
